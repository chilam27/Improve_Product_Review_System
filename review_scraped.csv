Dickies standardize your production, please
","
Dickies... you are starting to breaking my heart.  I have been ferociously loyal to you ever since I discovered your Original work pants back in 2010; I have always found your Original work pants to be comfortable, easy to care for and durable.  The last three pairs I have purchased probably puts my grand total up over ten pairs.However... I am beginning to notice an issue with the consistency of the waist size.  I am a 32"" waist, I know this because if I take a tailor's measuring tape and wrap it around my waist the starting ends meets the rest of the tape at, you guessed it, the 32"" mark.  I mention this standard unit of measure because the last three pairs of pants I have purchased from you have not, in fact, been sized/manufactured/labeled correctly.  Three pairs ago was a pair of 32x32 (my size for the last 6 years in these pants) and they were way too tight in the waist, I couldn't even imagine trying to go to work in those.  So a quick return and I order two pairs of 33x32, thinking that maybe your specs have changed over the last year or so.  Well, much to my disappointment these two pairs of pants aren't even uniform with one another: one is a true 33"" waist but the other is LESS than 32"" in the waist - it's like 31.5""!  So shame on me because I removed the tags of the second pair before I put them on, so now I can't return them.Like I said, generally speaking I really like this product and will likely order more of these pants in the future, but please fix whatever it is that's going on to effect your consistency is such a negative way.

THREE CHINOS
","
I ordered and received 3 pairs of ChinosAll the same day.Here are the results1 ~ IZOD Men's American Chino Flat Front Pant, Black, 36W x 32LThese are 100% Cotton and fit exactly the same as all my 36W x 32 L Wrangler jeans. love them. Perfect fit, perfect weight of fabric and all cotton. The perfect Chino.2 `~ Amazon Essentials Men's Classic-Fit Wrinkle-Resistant Flat-Front Chino Pant 36 x 32These are 60% Cotton, 40% Polyester and fit TIGHTER than the Izod. The fabric is of the same thickness as the IZOD. My main complaint is they fit too tight and the waist rolls over. That doesn't happen wtih the IZOD3 ~ Dickies Men's Original 874 Work Pant 36 x 32 These are 65% Polyester/35% Cotton. The fabric of this product is MUCH thicker than the IZOD and the Amazon Essentials. More like a thin Bluejean than a Chino. The MAIN problem is, I CAN'T GET THESE ON. The fit is SO tight I cannot CLOSE them no matter what I do. I tried lying on my bed, letting all my breath out and I STILL can't close them. This is REALLY a pathetic fit. As I said, I bought ALL three items on the same day and tried them before and after one washing for fit.SO, in my opinion, because of the VERY TIGHT FIT and the coarse and thicker fabric, I would say STAY AWAY from this item.The Amazon Essentials are good. Just wish the fit was a little looser in the waist compared to what they sent.The BEST of the bunch is the IZOD Men's American Chino Flat Front Pant. PERIODThe Dickies and Amazon brand are about 20 bucks each,The IZOD is $25 bucks.GO FOR THE EXTRA 5 BUCKS! and get the IZOD.

Perfect for work in the Food and Beverage industry
","
Perfect for work in the Food and Beverage industry, retail, deli, meat cotter, etc...  One small sizing note... I wear 34"" waist in most everything... I ordered that size first and they almost cut me in half trying to get through the whole day.  Very tight in the waist, but fit nicely in the butt, crotch and thighs.  So, I ordered the next size up, these 36"" inch ones thinking they should fit better.  Well, the waist was good.  And let me be clear, I am an actual 34"" waist guy... I am not in denial and not trying to jam a beer gut into pants that just aren't my size... These run small in the waist.  With that said, when Dickies goes from a 34"" waist to the 36"" waist, they make EVERYTHING bigger.  The waist fits great.  The butt area was literally twice the size.  So, I can breath now, but I have 80 year old man ass.Lastly and on a more positive note... These are built amazingly.  They will last you a long time.  They are super high quality, the pockets are cut perfectly, they hold a crease and look like new after every wash with no ironing.

What the???

Apparently a size 30 to these people translates to a size 25! Could barely get them over my thighs! What the hell Amazon/Dickies? Absolutely can't wear, as the clasps are around 1 inch from being able to close even in the most uncomfortable and tightest efforts. Buyer be ware! Will never buy from them again..(For the record I'm a loose wearing size 30 and am by no means unable to fit into an actual size 30 as it's what I currently wear everyday to work in pants made by multiple brands and have never had an issue.)

Very disappointed in size
","
Bought these for work pants, but also to hopefully replace the need for jeans. I stated with a 28 x 30 which is my normal size with other pants. The waist was much to tight to the point of pain. So i returned the pants and tried a 29 x 30 pair. This pair now is to loose around the waist by about 2 inches and the legs are to long by about 1-2 inches. Also it causes a large gap in the back of the waistline. I am having to many problems to give any further information. I must give up on this, and move on to something else.Also note: these pants are very very stiff at first. I'm not sure how much they will loosen up after a few washes since I never got to that point.

I have only bought Dickie work clothes since 1978 for myself and all the guys in my shop.  I was loyal to Dickie and would never think to buy another brand.  These pants do not fit my 135 Lb skinny body.  In the past I would order 30 x 30 without a thought.  These pants have a crummy short zipper and a crotch that has no room. Odd for the pants billed as original 874 fit.  I thought this must be a one time looser but I bought 2 other styles of Dickie pants recently with the same problem.Something has happened to the company to the point that they have driven away a loyal customer.  I am experimenting now with Red Kap.  Hopefully the supervise there offshore factories better.

Great pair of pants for a great pair of legs
","
So after looking in stores all around the Tampa Bay Area, I can’t find pants that I feel fit me the way I like.  So I turned to Amazon.  I’ve always liked Dickies pants in the past, and on Amazon, I’m able to find a vast range of sizes.  Found these bad boys and I couldn’t order them fast enough.First off, you can expect the same high-quality material as any Dickies pants bought from a store.  A tough waist band, pockets in the right places, and fits just as I’d expected.  With that being said, I’ve always found Dickies pants to run a little tight, and yes these are a little tight, AS EXPECTED.  If I go to Chipotle and get my usual beef burrito or to Outback for a 12oz sirloin with baked potato, salad and broccoli, these pants will fit much tighter than expected!  I would love for Dickies to incorporate a flexible waistband for my glutinous dinners, but alas, I enjoy these pants.  I would most likely be ordering them again.

The sizing is completely labeled wrong
","
I normally wear a 36 pants in jeans. These did not fit what so ever on me. I took a tailor's tape to see what the actual size is. They are labeled 36 but are size 30. Really disappointed with this. I ended up giving them to my friend who is a lot smaller than me and it fit him though he had to hem the legs because I am a tall and he is short. I would never buy any Dickies pants from Amazon again. I bought two pairs in two different colors. One was labeled ""Made in China"" the other was labeled ""Made in Mexico"". If you still want to buy them after I said my bit. Good Luck. They also shrink for some reason. And when I washed them I just used the Washing Machine and hung them up to dry in my spare bedroom.

A Bit Undersized/Oversized

I have had two version of these pants...This one, which is clearly marked 874 on the waistband inside...And another version, which is NOT marked on the inside, so I can't tell what model/series it is...Problem is, the 874's seem to be undersized, or the other ones are over-sized....They are both marked as a 38 waist, but one pair is tight and the other perfect/slightly loose...I bought a pair of #874 from WM and 2 pairs from Amazon and all 3 are under-sized...The ""no-number"" pair came from WM and fits good/is slightly loose...ALSO-I'm 6'2"" and yet have ""only"" an inseam of 31...30 is too short and 32 is too long as it drags on the ground (except with really thick-soled boots) and frays the bottom hem..SO one of the reasons to buy pants, etc online is the wider availability of ""ODD"" sizes...They only seem (seam?) to do EVEN inseam sizes in the stores, so they only have to carry half as many....BEWARE THE BUTTONS!I've had the ""GEORGE"" brand of pants pop buttons soon after buying them..As well as these...The ones that seem to hold up the best are the ones with the metal flat hook/eye type closure...I've also had these pants get small holes in them, but this was after 2-3 years of wearing them..Also be aware that these pants are HIGHLY STARCHED when new..They'd almost stand up by themselves!So you'll want to wash them before wearing them..All in all, despite size inconsistencies and the button issues, they generally wear well, esp for the price..

Order Yours a Couple Sizes Larger.  These Tend to Run Small.
","
First of all, the pants look great!  Pure white, and well finished.  These will be close to perfect for what I need them for....once I get some that fit.Now for the not so good:  The sizes seem to run small, which is unusual for Dickies.  I ordered a 38 inch waist band, but the pants I received are way smaller than that.  My guess would be that they are actually 34-35 inch waist..  I normally wear a 36 inch waist pants, but wanted something with a little more room to tuck in the uniform shirt.I am going to re-order these in a 40 inch waist.  Still a fan of Dickies workwear, and will recommend these if you need something really white and durable.  Just remember to order yours a couple sizes larger than you normally wear.The reason I docked a star is because of the sizing issue.  No issues with quality or appearance.  We will see how the new ones fit.

These are great work pants

These are great work pants, hence the reason my husband buys these 874 dickies. Problem is you can’t confidently order these online. There is no quality control. If you want dickies YOU HAVE TO BUY LOCAL!!  I ordered 3 pairs of 34x32 for my husband. One pair was correct in size, the other two were at least 2 inches smaller in the waist despite being labeled 34x32. I should have read through the reviews more closely because I see that this is a problem that’s been happening for a looong time. We buy online to save on trips to town from the ranch, but now we have to go In to return these to the UPS terminal anyhow... Defeats the purpose of buying this product online. Live and learn 😒

Solid working pants.
","
I'm a skinny, kinda tall guy. I find anytime I wear pants that fit my waist and height. My pockets are useless, and my junk is plain and visible for the world to see.But with these pants, so long as I'm wearing boxers, the crotch has plenty of room, and the pockets are actually usable. The only qualm I have with them are the belt loops. For such a functional pair of pants, the belt loops are pretty small. Making it impossible for me to wear my sturdier belt, suited for the various pouches I wear daily as an electrician.*edit*I forgot to mention, while these pants do have a pretty excessive amount of belt loops,making it difficult to use some wide belt pouches, you can get around this inconvenience easily by just using every other loop rather than every loop. you can even alternate the loops you use to spread out wear and tear so you can get some more mileage out of them if often put a lot of tension on them. Still wish they would make the loops larger, These would be absolutely perfect.

These Are Sturdy, Value Priced Work Pants For Everyone, Male Or Female!
","
I'm very happy with these pants. I love gardening and working around my home in ways that often involve crawling around on the ground, changing oil in yard machines or digging, which is not what you want to do in work pants you have forked over 75 bucks for to a woman's work wear catalog that restricts pants lengths and sizes. These pants let me do that without straining or restricting my movement. At $23 a pair I bought two brown and two black pairs at a little more than I would have paid and outfitted them with two inexpensive web belts to accommodate a belt belt sheath for a pruner. I am delighted with them. They soften up a bit after washing but still maintain a neat appearance.I am hardly the first woman to buy men's pants or jeans for working in because of the more varied sizing and lengths they are available in, as well as the frequently better price. Remember ladies, they ain't ""men's pants"" when you're in 'em!

Sizing Is Way Off - Order In Larger Size
","
As everyone knows, pant sizes always vary. For context I wear Dickies double knee work pants for work which are a size 34x32 that fit a little snug. Same with jeans, size 34 waist fit a little snug, but 36’s damn near fall off if anything heavy is in the pocket. So when I ordered these pants for a Jason Voorhees costume, I decided to just get a 36x32 so it would fit a little loose and I’d just wear a belt. Unfortunately when it arrived, I couldn’t even zip them up they were so tight, and the ends of the pants were like a solid few inches from hooking together, so there was so sucking it in to connect.These pair of pants run really small. I went to the mall down the road to see if I could find a pair of these pants in a larger size, which they had but not in this silver color that I needed. So I test fitted the pants they did have and the sizes didn’t get comfortable until I hit a 40 waist. That’s ridiculous, in the same brand I fit a 34. If you order these, get at least a size or two larger. Only reason I’m giving three stars is because with Prime, I got them pretty fast. I’ve place another order for a 40x32 in silver, hopefully there won’t be any tomfoolery

Way too small.
","
Based on reviews, I ordered a size up. I needed to order at least 2 sizes up, and considering shrinkage, probably three sizes up. That's crazy. That would make it 3 stars at worst, but having to pay to return and not being able to simply execute an exchange drop it one star.  $7+ to return, and I have to re-order in an appropriate size. Plus, this is the only Prime order I have ever had to pay return shipping on. I rarely need to return anything and I object to it not being made clear in advance that there would be a hassle involved in exchanging these Dickies Men's Original 874 Work Pants.

In reality nice enough to wear with a button down shirt out ...
","
Husband uses these pants for all his outdoor activities. They've become his favorites. The color is closer to a dark forest green rather than olive drab, but still very neutral. Wash up well-possibly have stain release because even red mud washes out without pre treating. Would give 5 stars if the fabric was a little smoother and if they had a button or snap closure (they have a metal hook and eye that won't stay closed in the washing machine.) They come out of the dryer wrinkle-free. Have probably been washed a dozen times already, and holding up very well. They fit him exactly true to size for waist and length, but not baggy in the butt. A straight leg not too wide but wide enough to fit over boot tops. In reality nice enough to wear with a button down shirt out for dinner at a sit down restaurant. Such a good price I would actually give 4.5 stars. Am going to reorder.

On this review I would have given it 5 Stars if I wouldn't have had to buy another pair because I didn't know that these pants run two sizes too small. When I first bought these I bought them in my correct size that I get in every pants but I got it in one half size bigger (I'm a 32 but got 33 for little more flexibility) and it did not fit at all it was literally probably a 29 because not even my brother could fit into them and he's a size 30.

Waste smaller than I expected
","
I ordered another pair since overall they seemed like what I was looking for.  I'm ""high waisted"" and wanted pants that sit high just below the belly button.  These did.  But although I've lost several pounds and normally wear a 32 or at most 33 waist these were very tight.  Could be because they sit so high?  But it's something to consider if you're looking at these.  I was able to get them fastened (metal hook style) but way too tight to be comfortable so I ordered a 34 and hope it'll be about right but not too loose if I lose a few more pounds.

As soon as I opened the plastic bag that actually contained the pants, not just the Amazon package but the bag the pants were actually in, it smelled of rubber. At first I thought it smelled like burnt rubber, but when I smell the pants themselves they reeked of a rubber smell. I was disgusted, infuriated, but remained calm.I took them through the wash and the smell is gone. I don't know what's going on in the storage facility that these came out of, but someone needs to get there Warehouse straight. That smell was enough that I almost return these.Otherwise, these look exactly the way I expected them to look.

A Classic
","
Solid pair of durable workpants. I've had a black pair for a while now that I tapered in the past, so I thought it was time to get a pair in navy.For those of you that haven't purchased a pair of 874's before, here are some things to know.They sit at your natural waist. This is something that you have to get used to if you currently wear low waisted pants. It can be uncomfortable to begin with, but overall its more flattering for your posterior and waist.They are a little snug around the thighs and flare at the ankles. If you have larger thighs like me, it can be a little restrictive. I'm 6'1 and 150 lbs, leaning towards the skinny side. I got them in a size 30 x 29 so I could have them slightly cropped. In the past, I had a 30x30, which fit pretty much perfectly with a cuff.Here are some of my cons regarding the pants. Out of the package, the starchiness of the pants can be a little abrasive on your thighs. This is something I got used to, but be warned. The first pair is always damn itchy. The center crease and the starchiness of the pants disappear after a couple washes. After about 2 washes, the center crease becomes almost unnoticeable. It takes about 20-30 washes for it to be slightly softer. I wish it would stay starchy for longer, but that's just a consequence of washing your clothes. I also dislike the way the fly bulges outwards near the belt. It's a hook and loop closure, which doesn't sit as flush as a button and buttonhole closure. This makes it push out near the belt loops.All in all, it's a steal for the price. Sturdy construction, classic colors, and cheap price. Would definitely recommend.

Inconsistent size and quality, never buying another pair
","
I've had enough of these, I'll never buy another.  I've gotten a few of these over the last few years and found the waist fitment to be snug, but close enough for a work pant that I didn't want to belt.  But this last pair I got I could barely pull them up over my thighs and couldn't even get close to latching them.  I took them off and measured the band and compared it to one of my it-fits-but-its-snug pair and they measured THREE INCHES less!  And they are tagged as the same size.  Yeah, right.  Worst of all I had already removed the tags and washed them beforehand since the last four pairs had fit, so I'm stuck with them.The inconsistent sizing isn't the only reason I'm swearing off these.  The stitching quality is also all over the place.  I've had pairs with no problems, but others that have blown a seam in weeks.  The weirdo small waist pair had the corner of one of the pockets blow out when I was taking them off, and I hadn't even worn them for a single day yet (...because they didn't fit).  I've had another pair where the zipper refused to stay zipped and I had to add a loop to the zipper pull that fit into the latch so it couldn't fall down once the paints were clasped.Sorry Dickies, you've lost me as a customer.

Defect on fabric and...
","
I found this white-line on the back of the leg. I tried wiping it off but it wouldn't come off so I took a closer look and seems to be a defect, somehow. I ordered two sizes, to save time (36 and 38) and was surprised that the 38 waist was still very tight but I needed something for tomorrow so I needed to make a choice. Either take it or go to work and meet my bosses out-of-uniform. The pants were extremely long, usually, a 34 inseam fits fine but not this time and had to do some last-minute sewing. I decided not to cut so the additional hem I needed was 4inches on each leg.  Do you do any quality control?

Bought these for use at work. I work in a hospital environment where I have to look professional but can get messy at times. I spent $ 25 on each pair of pants and they look like more expensive pants. They feel a little funny at first. Very stiff the first time you wear them. Belt loops just barely fit my belt. The front pockets are somewhat smaller than my jeans pockets. But they are very durable and easy to clean when you get into a mess. They definitely fit the ""office Casual"" dress code. Perfect for my job. I'd assume they'd be good for many applications. Car repair, pest control, restaurant or other jobs where there is a need to look decent but not worry so much about your clothes getting dirty. Two thumbs up!!! Highly recommended.

Bought a few pair of these. Fit was good and my favorite thing about the Dickies pants is their flexibility at work. I sometimes have to navigate my big body into awkward positions and the last thing I need is to be fighting my pants while doing so.That is where the positive ends though. The second time I wore one pair an almost perfectly right angle hole formed around the left pocket. I can't thing of what could have caused this except a defect in the fabric. Long lasting wear for work is supposed to be one of the strong suits when going with Dickies.May have to look elsewhere to see if I can find the flexibility offered here without poor quality control.

Dickie's have always been my favorite - recognized brand of work clothing for many yrs. These fit me quite well with no issues. The belt loops are a nice width , which is better - compared to other brands. As for stiffness which is a noted issue with most new clothing, I simply wash warm - mild laundry detergent , No Fabric Softener , ( Dry ) on Low Heat , or ( Delicate ) setting, Using these methods will noticeably improve the comfort of these pants noticeably - the first & second time. Using these methods gave me a good reason to order a 2nd pair, since I ordered these several years previously from Amazon .

Just Right (for Me)
","
I'm short and I'm skinny. For me, these pants fit great at the waist- no bagginess and while I wear a belt, there's no need to. My Greek beer belly hangs over the waist in the most perfect of ways. If you like a roomy waist, order up. But what if you have to outrun a wild animal, like a bear? Be careful.The length is also wonderful; not too long and not too short. My Dickies dungarees are too long by a few inches and so I roll those up like a 50's greaser; but I don't need to do so with these. There's plenty of room in the thighs/legs, but not too much room. I can leave the excess of the last few decades behind without being forced to embrace men's yoga pants.I love these pants. I plan to buy anywhere between one and one million more pairs.Peace.

Very versatile pants for both tough work and business casual

These are very versatile pants.  They can be worn for dirty jobs or even with a tie if you like in a more business casual setting.  In my case, I am a middle school teacher and teach theater tech so I spend time building and working on sets in the theater.  Additionally, I have to wear a tie and dress shirt when I teach in the classroom.  These pants work for both.  Off comes the shirt and tie when I build sets and back on when I enter the classroom.  These pants wash easily, don't need ironing when taken out of the dryer quickly, are tough/durable, and as I said, versatile.  That said, I wouldn't wear them in a very dressy environment as the pants do have a ""Dickies"" tag visibly below the rear pocket.  The two navy choices (dark and light), olive, and khaki work well in a business casual setting.These are great in the winter but can be a little warm in the summer.  The material is very tough and pretty thick compared to regular cotton khakis so that's worth considering.As many have said, get one size larger than you are.  They run just a little big IMHO.

I've been buying these pants in charcoal, khaki, and now black for the past 3 years. My husband said these are the best work pants he has ever owned. According to him, they are sturdy and comfortable. They do not pinch or ""crowd"" him, and he finds it easy to squat, kneel, and move at work.The biggest issue is the size. These run small as everyone has been saying. We were surprised when we ordered his true size and had to send them back. So, I just keep re-ordering the larger size so that they can fit. I will admit that these pants last so long that we keep forgetting the larger size isn't incorrect. (He is a 38 and I had to purchase a 42- Not a tailored-fit. They are a bit too big in some places.)Overall, they are worth the buy.

I have 2 pair of 874's and couple other Dickies pants.I like the 'weight' and thickness of the fabric.  Stiff when new, but I like how durable they are.They are a bit small, but I'm between 36 and 38, so the 38's actually fit me better than most other pants.Permanent press and stain resistance are bonuses that make them even more versatile.I like the style - or is it lack of style.  They are just pants, which is just what I want.I'm not crazy about the wide and short (height) belt loops.  Means I can't wear my wide and thick belt with these.  And I can't clip things to the belt loops without using an adapter I made from paracord.I'm also not a fan of the front tab-slot connector.  Sometimes when I tighten my belt it comes un-done.

874 is the workhorse of dickies
","
Ive been wearing dickies for over 25 years...Ive had many types of pants like the cargo pocket pants, the flex material pants, dickies shorts and the 874 pants.The 874's seem to retain their color and sturdiness the best...I believe they are a slighty thicker material than all the other types of dickies. I generally get 12 to 18 months out of them working in a sheetmetal environment as for all the other pants they would wear thin and get faded in 4-6 months.This is rotating 5-6 pairs of pants 6 days a week.I like them a little loose on the legs/thighs so I generally buy up 1 size on the waist.

I purchased these for my boyfriend to wear to work. He will tear through your average pair of jeans there in a week, but these have really held up. At work he does lots of squatting, bending, works with grinders, paint, and so on. They've held up well for the past 2 months, no signs of the usual crotch tears or zipper separation. He told me they fit well, we ordered one size up in the waist for better freedom of movement. Nothing really to report negatively. Great size selection as his is sometimes hard to find in stores, colors true to description, and at a great price! Once he burns through a few more pairs of old pants they will be replaced with these.

Durable, Great Look and Fit!

I am very happy with these Dickies Original 874 Work pants. Great price on Amazon.... Plus I am not crazy about Cargo style pants for work with all those extra pockets... These don't have the Cargo look... They look more like khakis/semi dress pants.. But the have an obvious added durability for work use.For the size.. Mine fits great thanks to following the majority reviewers' advice to go one size larger.... I had been wearing size 33 in another brand of khaki pants, trying to loose weight, I would like the idea of fitting into 32 and I can with some pants.... I swallowed my pride and ordered 34.. Good fit, fits more like the 33 in the other Khakis I had.Summed up Great price and seems they may well last longer than other higher priced pants. Also great color selection! Totally recommend.

Smaller waist than other Dickies
","
These 32in waist Dickies are smaller in the waist than the 32in double knee Dickies (both regular and relaxed fit). I am trying to lose weight, so I'm hoping they'll fit better soon, but as is... I can only wear them for a limited time, without tucking in a shirt, when I'm not sitting much, not to a big meal.... or some combination there of. I've laid them across Dickies I've had over the last 3 years, as well as some I received in this same shipment... all 32s.... ALL bigger than this pair. I actually came back to this listing to see what I'd ordered, and double checked the tags to make sure everything was right. Either Dickie's screwed up, or this ""cut"" is simply not to size (other reviews hint towards this)

Absolute Wrong Fit and Horrible Quality Assurance
","
First of all I ordered a 36W / 37L, and I received a 36UU. I don’t know what UU means, but if this supposed to be a 36W, it is not. All my pants are 36W, but this does not even come close. I had probably a good 3-4” before these would even come close to uncomfortably fitting me before exploding.Even worse, look at my picture of the pants. That is the bottom of my pants! Notice how it’s just cut off at the bottom in a saw pattern. Good grief! There is nothing sewn at the bottom. It is literally cut off in a zig zag. What kind of quality assurance is happening at Dickies?This is the first and last time I buy anything from Dickies. The pants themselves also feel cheap and thin.

My husband owns 3 pair of the exact pants which we purchased from a Tractor Supply store. Black, navy and gray. He wanted other colors so I ordered the green and khaki in the same size and style as the ones he currently has. When he got them and he put them on he couldn't button them at all.  I checked the style number and size again with the 3 pair he currently owns and they matched. I have no idea why these are so much smaller than the ones we currently own. We returned them.

Waistband material not as sturdy as past pairs. Decreasing material quality is a bad decision.
","
Over the last  five years, I have noticed the quality of materials in these pants decreasing. For example, the waistband material is not as stiff and the pant crease is lost after only a three washings.  The waist band now loses its shape and curls easily and I have even found the metal hook at the bottom of my clothes washing machine when it just fell off the pants.  It's disappointing to find the quality of the product less while the price remains stable. I understand that items cost more over time. The quality should remain high and the price can rise.  I shop for quality items not lowest price.

Slacks are well made and sturdy material with more thickness than typical, nice attention to detail.  I actually returned them because the waist was a bit loose but hips a bit tight, and the legs are very straight cut, maybe a bit too roomy for me.  I think the pants live up to the work category, more stylish than denim, just not a good match for my build. Quality materials and custom sizing appreciated but you may need to go an inch larger in the waist.

You really can't go wrong with solid work pants than Dickies. These are great, tough and don't require ironing. Please be aware if you're new to Dickies they run small at the waist.

There is no where in this world that these are sized correctly!  Dickies needs to reconsider their sizes, and label them honestly.  All three pairs are going back, and quite frankly, I'm disappointed at just how small they were.  My husband tried these on in store, just to see what size would have worked, and barely fit into 3 sizes up in this 874 cut.  He's the same size in every other brand, so it's just in Dickies.If you do order them, SIZE UP.  Like way up.

If you haven't worn Dickies brand clothes, I'll break it down real quick: it's a durable clothing that allows you to choose color and style that match both your needs and your penchant.  You have to read the featues of the pants before you buy them and look at them carefully because there are minor variations that make them suitable for different work environments. The different types are actually different pants/ shirts / coats etc. entirely.  Don't get click happy and buy one with an unwanted tool loop or a cell pocket or reinforced exterior joint stitching just because you didn't read.I've never had deviations in Dickies.

I trusted the reviews and they came through for us!  I read the amount of reviews saying to go a size up - Jim wears a 36 x 36  - He always has - he is a tall, lean man and 38's in other brands would have been too large and remained that way after washing - they would have just been uncomfortable in some areas due to the extra material.  So, I went the next size up on these - he said they felt good - he wore them with a belt - the next day - I washed them - no shrinkage - Perfect!  He said they are comfortable and he can bend and squat, get on his knees to pull weeds, climb a tree branch to trim, etc without feeling uncomfortable.  We are so happy about finding these and the price here on Amazon.  I will be ordering a few more now that we know.We have been buying his pants at Gander for twice the price due to his height and size - within months - he had a hole in knees due to his job as a landscaper - I hope these last longer than months but for the price - we are happy to try them.  We ordered the olive which is a fabulous color and matches everything.  Jim has been wearing this daily for a few weeks now and very happy with them - we are not seeing any wear signs in the knees and the color has stayed true.Thank you reviewers!!!

Shallow Pockets!

These pants are exactly what I expected them to be considering the price I paid for them. They fit well and look really neat and professional. The only thing I don’t like about them is the pockets. The pockets on these pants are really shallow. You can’t fit a smartphone or anything else inside the pockets because the pockets aren’t deep enough. My iPhone and other objects have fallen out of my pockets while wearing these pants. Don’t put anything valuable inside of your pockets because it’s going to fall out and get lost.

I appreciate that these pants have a sufficiently long fly. So many work and casual pants these days are fitted with an annoyingly impractical short zipper. If you wear your pants near or just below your waist you have to fish your equipment up and over the jagged teeth of the fly to take a leak. Not so with these. I really like the Lincoln Green version of these trousers. Definitely a retro color from the 50’s-60’s.I’d love this exact product in 100% cotton for summer wear.I wish they  were cut just a skosh fuller in the seat. I’m very pleased.

Good pants, classic fit, they haven't messed with them, unlike Levis and 501's. I ordered my usual size, they're about a half-inch small, but they stretch out a bit with wearing. Length is perfect. Should be very  comfortable when the sizing washes out.  I have two minor gripes: the front pockets would be easier to get into if they had more slash, and belt loops are too small for 11/2 inch ballistic belts -- I like the tunnel shape, though. I'll buy them again, might try one inch up next time.

The pants seem like they would be very durable, with a coarse material that seems strong but maybe not the softest like khakis.  The one issue that caused me to return them is where the pants sit.  They sit at my belly button, which I did not see anywhere in the listing that they sat so high.  This may be the reason many reviews said that the pants feel tight. If they sat close to the hip I believe more people would find them comfortable.  Another issue I had is that the pockets seem smaller than normal pants, not leaving much room for a wallet or cell phone and still being able to walk comfortably.  I'll be trying another pair of dickies to seek a better fit for me.

These are the same 874 standard work pants Dickies has made forever. Aside from being starchy as hell when new, taking a couple of wash cycles to loosen back up, they are still the best and most comfortable work pants you can get. They can even be worn casually and aren’t that unstylish.

Classic affordable work pant
","
The most important thing to remember when ordering is to size up, as many reviews here indicate. These are classic work pants that have been around forever, and can be compared as far as longevity is concerned to the utilitarian Levi's 501. For example, my grandfather wore these daily. Not too tight or too baggy, always appropriate. Versatile enough to be used for manual labor or dressing up slightly. As others have noted, my only issue was the smell of these pants upon arrival. The only way I can describe the odour of these pants is as if they were constructed from fish food, pungent enough to be detected at a distance. Fortunately, this disappeared after the first wash. The only other issue is that unlike twill cotton chinos, these have a high polyester content, which results in a rigid plastic-like feel before breaking in. This is the tradeoff for durability at a low price.  If you're more concerned about looks (fit and material feel) over durability, 100% cotton chinos are a better option. But for this price-point the durability and versatility is hard to beat.

These are good pants, classic and durable. It comes out of the bag pretty stiff, it just needs to be broken into. A lot of people ran into some sizing problems and it is highly suggested you get a size larger than your waist size. Since the fabric has no stretch whatsoever, you need to at a minimum get a size that is exactly your waist measurements. However, if you want to actually be able to bend or sit in these, get a size or two larger. Remember, the size you choose is the size of the pants not the size of your waist.

The 874 Classics seemed like a bargain--great price and decent quality, but the front pockets are ridiculously shallow. They're so bad you have to take out your cell phone when you sit down so that it doesn't jab into your body. Not sure how this simple problem was never rectified. Maybe back when these pants were designed, most men only had two keys and a money clip. The pants are tight at the waist, too.

Dickies used to be pretty good...

The single stitch that holds the left side of the zipper has come out of 2 of the 4 pairs of these pants that I have had for only 3 months!! Might just as well walk around with my zipper undone and balls out at that point! I've been buying and wearing Dickies pants for 20 years and have never had this issue. When 1 of the 4 did it I just figured it was a fluke and had my wife sew it back together but then the 2nd of 4 is doing it... ridiculous!

Good quality Dickies 874 work pants
","
I normally wear another national brand of work pants that fits my stout build better than the W or L brands. This is my first pair of Dickies and I'm quite pleased. Fabric for a twill is heavy (but not like the ""fire hose"" type) and should wear well, Belt loops are wide and they're located at the correct spots. I like the slip clasp at the waist versus a button. Zipper is robust & pockets are deep.

If you don't normally wear Dickies just know that they do run small. You absolutely should get a size up. Don't think oh they'll fit me.. no you should buy a size up. That warning aside Dickies are great and inexpensive pants. They last longer than any of my Levi's which end up looking worn rather quickly. I have Dickies in my closet that I've had for years and I still wear.

two different colors very good value, and had a 31"" inseam I needed
","
Bought 10 pairs,  two different colors very good value, and had a 31"" inseam I needed.The only problem I find with the 874 work pants  is for some reason 1 of the pants leg the crease seams to be twisted toward the outside, some worse than others.  I did check to make sure the pants centered at the waist and with both feet straight forward, I found that 4 out of the 10 pairs had the twist and most times its the left leg, starts slightly at the knee and increases more down at your shoe. I did return the 4 that were the worse and they sent a return label even though I offered to pay the return shipping, I also got replacements only to find 2 of the 4  with the same problem, tried 1 more time and returned the replacements again. yes I understand these are work pants but I also work both in the shop & office and like to be dressed properly when I meet callers but also need to be able to work in a shop area that needs pants that can take that kind of abuse.yes I will buy more when these start to ware, if Dickies could correct this problem the pants would be perfect.

Great value; ordered a size up and they fit perfectly
","
These are an excellent value for the money for yard and house work. The material is neat looking but tough; it is a heavy weave but breathes and is suitable for 9-season use in Michigan. I have had low cost work pants with flimsy pockets that developed holes within a few months. The Dickies pockets seem durable, though I wish they were a touch deeper. The zipper-another area where some manufacturers skimp- also works smoothly and seems durable. After reading many reviews, I ordered an inch larger waist that my normal size of 32 and the pants fit perfectly; the inseam is true to size.  They are spacious but not baggy, and the 874 work pant sits comfortably high on the waste. I anticipate ordering an additional pair. Only complaints -- the single clasp closure is not terribly secure (wear a belt), the pockets could be a touch deeper, and I wish they had a dedicated cell phone pocket. But for what I paid (about $20 bucks) this is a 5-star purchase.

I loved these for my husband for a while, but now I know their sizing is off. I bought a size up. Unfortunately, the 36 and 38 are same width. There's no possible way my husband stretched out over an inch of fabric to equal the size difference. I work with textiles. Grab a towel or even a pair of your jeans in your house and see how far it stretches. Even with over time wear and tear material has a literal breaking point, before it gives or breaks down. More than an inch, is beyond a break point/wear show point. Even with reinforcement.

Bad Sizing

I thought I've gotten to the point where I could freely order every pair of pants on the internet in my size without getting it wrong SIKE. EVERY SINGLE pant in my wardrobe ranging from a variety of brands is a waste 33. I order these dickies pants at a 33 waste, and this waste is literally a 28...  So extremely tight that I cannot put them off even if I cut out my internal organs. Putting them on was so embarrassing, despite being the only one in the room. Did I gain 20-30 pounds in my waste or something? I check the reviews and there are plenty of people having this problem. I really want an all-white pant to go with my white dickies shirt, so I ordered a 36/30, hoping it'd be wearable. I should not have to order 3 sizes up. I will be returning my first pair and I'll update on what I get tomorrow...I hate returning things so thanks allot dickies.

If not for the Dickies logo stitched on the hip pocket nobody would ever know the difference.Problem with buying these pants locally is that I can find them in only khaki or blue, and the latter won't cut it in the office.  Via Amazon I can order more colors; not that I care but the wife tells me it is important not to wear the exact same thing every day (like bluejeans and t-shirts??).Pants fit as expected.  They are durable, hold up to years of wash-and-wear, and come in a wide range of colors.  Good to find a quality product that won't go out of production next year because a new model comes along.

I truly love the 874 Dickies work pants.  They are awesome and nearly indestructible.  They may not be the softest or the warmest pants, but they always look new, they never shrink, and they're available in a bunch of colors.  I have a pair for each day of the week; I only replace them about every 5 years.  With Dockers, I needed new ones after a year of regular use (and they cost a lot more).  Dickies last longer, look brand new for virtually the whole time, don't shrink over time, and cost less.  I will never buy another brand of work pants unless Dickies changes these.  I cut off the Dickies tag as I'm not a big fan of the orange; as long as you do this when they're first purchased, you'll never be able to tell the tag was there.  I wish the waist sat just a little lower on the waist, but that's a minor squabble given the overall quality and value.  These are also very consistent.  One size fit exactly the same in 4 different colors; that never happened with Dockers.

They fit fine at the waist and through the legs, but the seat is so frickin' baggy it looks like you're wearing a pair of jumbo Huggies with a full load. I can't speak for my fellow man who may be generously proportioned through the midsection and bottom, but for a tall H/W/P guy like myself, these things look downright ridiculous the way they billow and hang down in back.

From Dickies website, though these are the 874 work trousers, mentions the following about sizing for their coveralls:""LENGTH: We suggest using your same inseam measurement for pants, but subtracting 1 to 2 inches to accommodate Dickies lower crotch construction.""Again, the above sizing recommendation is for their coveralls, but the 874's do also seem to have a good amount of room or area.

I ordered the wrong size at first and had to utilize the free returns from Amazon and had them ship the correct size. That isn't on the pant itself though but on myself. Do yourself a favor and measure with a sewing or body tape measure before you order to get your measurements. You can also use a string and standard ruler.  I ordered based on what I was wearing for jeans and I found out that the size listed on my jeans is actually off from my actual waist size.The quality of the material is reason I wanted Dickies as well as hard to find white work pants which is what I need for my job.  The material is more durable and heavy duty than the uniforms that works provides. This will help with how long the pants are good for but may not be ideal for those looking for light pants in hotter environments.Coupled with the Dickies Chef White Work shirts and I have my complete work uniform!

You must know your size after reading size issues, I looked up my sizes in other pants yes all are Dickies. I noticed that I've gotten a little more portly in recent purchases. The brown seems to be a little stiffer matirial which means they will last. They did take much longer to deliver than it was indicated while purchasing; pay attention to the amount listed in stock.

High quality but the waist runs small
","
I have been wearing a 34-inch waist size for at least the past 30 or more years, but for these pants I had to order a 36-inch waist. I rated this ""fits as expected"" only because other reviewers warned about this issue, so I knew what size to order.This is one the few Dickies styles that is intended to have the waist band sit at the natural waist line. Many other Dickies styles, as well as several other brands, are intended to be worn somewhat lower than that, so for those the stated waist sizes can be even more misleading.The fabric is extremely stiff, but after after being washed once or twice, it's fine.For years I've been wearing the Roebucks brand pants that were sold by Sears until they were discontinued a few years ago. Except for needing a 2-inch larger waist size, I find these pants to be an almost perfect replacement for the Sears.

Why I dislike. Is that it feels like used pant.  Labels wasn’t on it.  I ordered. Two pairs of dickes pants in varies color.  Two came in with labels on it. And feels stiff. Like a brand new.  Then the desert sand color dickies pant came in. It felt like been worn. Or been washed and dried.  And not even a label on it. And not folded like a brand new will does.  I’m irritated about this. I can’t even do nothing about it.  I’m on house arrest.  I cAnt even send it back. By going to post office.  I’m really irritated.  I’m noticing some stuff about amazon.  It’s like they are sending us a mark down clothing supplies. Or something defect with it. Or a returned clothing.  Over all I had a good delivery with foxes shirts or dickes. But my vans shoes that I ordered was little defected. Also and my dickies pant was not brand new.  That s questioning me more and now I’m afraid To order some more.

Excellent Dickies product. Apparently Dickies clothing has been popular, which makes me smile. I like the brand for its practicality and durability. My kid needed work pants, so these came to mind. Unfortunately they were a bit too long, which meant I had to break out my meager sewing skills and hem the pants. And they turned out! Good fit, just what we expected, enough room to bend and move but not so loose a belt is necessary. Great looking, no-nonsense pants. Very pleased with these.

These pants are nice, especially for the money.  Obviously pants are not easy to buy without trying on but given the low price I decided to go for it.  I am built a little thick and usually wear 38x30 and occasionally 40x30. I decided to go for the 38 and they are snug around the butt/upper thigh.  Usually when pants are tight on me it is the lower thigh so I was a little surprised.  They do fit but if you are torn between two sizes go for the larger one.  Probably a good thing to motivate me to lose a couple pounds.  They do look sharp and I wear them to work as business casual all of the time.

I had to return them.

These pants have maintained the same quality and fit for years. I have ordered the same thing several times over a period of a dozen years or so.

Dickies quality has gone downhill over the years. Sizing is inconsistent and inaccurate. Ordered a 34"" waist and it fits like a 32"" instead. My previous pair was more or less accurate.

Practical Soft-Wear in Black
","
Been wearing these for years.  They get thread-bare, but that's about it.  Save my too worn Dickies for work pants, paint paints.  Rotate seven pairs.  Like the fit, like the many and wide belt loops, like the black, like the price.  Look forward to dressing-up in a new pair.  The newness holds for about five washing.  Then it's practical, soft-wear in faded black.  Best to use dryer on pants.  Line-drying leaves lint and balls.  Not a bad blend of cotton/poly, however.  The balling is not too big a problem..Levis?  Everyone wears them.  Too common.  Like sneakers, a craze that refuses to die.  Most fits don't look so good -- or maybe it's most bodies in levis don't look so good.  Seems that every mother wants to make denim pants in every fit imaginable.Levis get dirty-looking, fast.  Show prior stains.  The get rumpled-looking fast.  Put them on in the morning, and by the end of the day they look as if you've worn them all week.  About the first hour on, that's when they are looking their best.  Or from a distance, as in looking at James Dean from a distance, white cotton long-sleeve shirt and faded 501's.  Otherwise, give me Dickies.

I have to wear black or khaki pants to work, and being a cat owner I can't really go with black. Despite the dress code I handle some pretty gross stuff, and I've ruined almost every pair of khakis I own. These work pants are the answer. They look just like ""real"" dress pants, but they're heavy material and they've got some sort of anti-liquid/anti-stain treatment on them. Water just beads off, solid stuff just wipes off or washes out without staining.My only gripes, and both minor:1: The fly isn't a button, it's a sort of tab/loop thing. Sometimes it comes unhooked. I always wear a belt anyway, so this isn't a huge problem.2: The side pockets could be a lot deeper. There is a shower of change whenever I sit down, but so far I haven't managed to lose my car keys.I think I'm going to end up buying a ton of these.

Wow. Ive never been more dissapointed in a piece of clothing. First, the waist runs a touch small fresh out of the bag. Probably .5-1” under advertised size.

My 38” waist paints which were already borderline, are less than a 34” measured waist after one standard 45 minute dry cycle. FOUR INCHES of waist shrinkage in one dry cycle.

Wearing them for over 38 yrs
","
My husband has been wearing Dickies uniform sets for over 38 yrs. he is tough on them and they hold up well. Very few have been replaced due to rips or wearing out. They are usually replaced for stains and glue that won't come off, hazards of the job. My father wore Dickies for many years before my husband. He retired in 1995 and when he passed away this last year we found many sets he still wore around the house from the 1990's still in excellent condition. They are a well made product, a good name. My husband tried a few other brands and none were as good or held up as well. He will not wear any other type now.  If your looking for a solid set of work clothes that look professional and wear well, you can't do better than this.

The company that supplies uniforms where I work uses Red Kap brand workpants.  I don't know exactly why eleven pairs of pants all fit differently.  Ranging from too loose to too tight, too small to too large.  Some that fit in the butt and legs are too tight in the waist.  Too tight in the butt and legs, but the waist is fine.  All are supposed to be the same size (waist and inseam).  Zero stars for Red Kap.  Five stars for Dickies.  All pairs purchased fit exactly the same.  I tried them on at a local store before buying them from Amazon so I knew what size to purchase and it was the size I expected to need.  They are a bit stiff when new, but I expect that to improve over time.

Great Pants but fit is very small
","
I have owned Dickies products for years and have always found them to be great work in yard/weekend pants but I forgot that they run small, very small. The label stated that they were Original fit or something like that so I figured since I had loss 10 pound they would fit but be snug. Nope, I couldn't even button them.  I advise you purchase 2 sizes less, i.e. if you wear a 38, buy a 36.  Dickies are a quality product but when other companies started increasing pant sizes to make men feel better about being overweight Dickies didn't get the memo, which is OK by me.  I'll just have to order a size up and hope that fits.

Durable. Somewhat comfortable.

Blue collar jobs require some comfort level. I have an average build and this pant fits me well in all sorts of positions. Whether squatting to pick up a heavy object or climbing across blocked off areas to get merchandise, this pant gives me ample room. If you have thicker thighs, that might be a problem. After 10+ washes, it's still rough. I don't mind though. I normally wear a 30 L and it should be fine but this one seems to ride up on the back of the shoe. It didn't shrink or anything after the washes but it just needs a tug to get it back down after going up stairs. Maybe I'll get the 31 L next time. The waist was fine. Big plus is that my sweat doesn't show through under the waist line for some reason. That's good because w/ my old pants, once the sweat dried, it would leave a white residue on my backside.

If you are on the large side of build you'll discover that Dickies is missing out on a lot of uneven waist sizes and color options at the high end. I'm really more of a 35x31 but Dickes doesn't offer pants in that size so I bought one size above which is fine for the inactive portion of the year as I gain more weight but as summer rolls around again and I loose some weight I'll end up using a belt.Personally I like the darker offerings, but still, if you are a large size you'll also notice that Dickies doesn't have the same color options available for smaller waist sizes.Regardless, these are classy work pants and plenty durable unless you are handling hay bales on a daily basis.

Can't complain, too much...

For the price, being a well known brand, they are very well constructed pants made of a durable material. I have no doubt they will last me many years.Now for the particulars. First a little background on me. I'm a bit of a bigger guy with a few extra pounds  around the middle, thus the reason for buying my pants in the size I do.  While I, technically, have only a 31"" inseam, I get 32's so that when I put them on, I don't end up looking like I'm wearing high-waters.As to the length, they seem to fit the same as any other pair of pants or jeans I own. As for the waist, that's a different story. Unlike the 2 big names in jeans, Levi's and Wrangler's, who also make ""pants"", these particular pants run a little on the small side.  More like I'm trying to squeeze into my old 34's.Regarding the overall fit, unlike the affore mentioned Wrangler's that contain enough material to make a second pair of pants, these fit more like a good pair of Levi's.  That is, they don't give the appearance of sporting a sail or parachute when wearing them.  On a similar note, they are not as ""form fitting"" as the Levi's. However, they DO ride much closer to the leg than that other brand, making them an overall good looking, mostly comfortable pair of pants.

I'm lucky in that I work out quite a lot, I'm tall and nicely proportioned. As a result my body is generally a good fit for many clothes. That's also true of these pants, which I purchased in two colors, both of which fit identically (that's a good sign of quality manufacturing).Downside is that the pants are designed to for at the natural waist, which is basically to say way the heck up there. These sit at least two inches higher up than any pair of Dockers I've ever owned. The resulting look is not flattering. Wiggle them down and they eventually ride back up and get uncomfortable.If you like really long in the crotch pants, these are for you. The cut is a hair tight in the hips/butt on me, but that is likely due to weight work making my butt a little big for my waist size.

These pants are not sized in inches, and I don't know what they are sized in. If you go with your actual waist size, it will be too big by a few inches, and this may have just been for me, but when I ordered it having subtracted the extra few inches from around the waist, it fit very tightly. My suggestion is to buy them in a proper store, buy better pants, or to buy a pair with your actual waist size, then buy one with you having subtracted the extra few inches around the waist and adding one inch and return the first pair, but nobody wants to do that.

I love Dickies a ton, so does my husband. But they were quite small. He usually wears a 32x32 and these were both too tight and too short. We ended up ordering a 36x34 to replace them and those worked much better. As for quality and style, they are awesome! They are kind of thick, what normal Dickies feel like I guess. My husband wears them for work and we are about to order some more in different colors!

My son wears 28 36 pants, he's super thin and almost 6'. I was excited to find him nice looking pants for church...they were not hemmed at the ankle! So I'm giving these 2 stars because although they look nice, fit well, I did not expect an unfinished product especially with the price being average.

These pants are so small at the waist I can’t even button them.  I always wear a 34 waist .  All of my other pants & jeans are 34, no issues at all. So I bought a 36 waist after reading some reviews of the pants running small.  I can barely button the 36s. I’m now ordering a 38 waist, which is 4 sizes bigger than what I actually wear. Unbelievable!

My husband has always worn jeans to work (construction sites). We are in Florida and he was dying this summer and we finally decided to try a different fabric for his work pants. He says these are heavy duty but he can still feel air moving through them, unlike his jeans. Now he prefers these and we have ordered enough for a two week supply. The only downfall is that he has torn one of the pockets away from the pants slightly. But he says it is because he is very rough when shoving tools in his pockets.

Right size, But too Tight in the Seat, Crotch and Thigh
","
These seemed great when I opened them! Nice, durable material, well known manufacturer of great quality goods. What could go wrong? I've been a 30/30 since 1989. If anything, I've become smaller. With that said; It seems the proportions of these pants are WAY off. These pants fit like jeans in the eighties! The waist fit great. The length was good. But the seat, crotch and thigh were so tight I looked like Cheryl Tiegs!!!  If I went up to a 32, the waist would be way to big. The only thing I can assume is these were irregular. But instead of trying another pair I just bought the Dickies Loose Fit Double Knee and they fit great!  I won't buy these again. And I won't recommend them to any people that I know that aren't anorexic!

To start; I know my size. These pants were WAY too small in the waste. What would be a 31 in ANY other brand fit like a 28.

These are my husband's favorite work pants. Local stores have stopped carrying them in anything close to his size (38/26) so we are very glad to see them here. A 38/30 was the closest to his size we could get. Fortunately I am able to hem them and not have to pay someone else for the alteration. However, if anyone else is shortening these (or other) pants, measure BOTH inseams, because I found there to be a half inch difference in the existing inseams on the same pant, so I had to shorten each leg a different amount to make the final inseams match. Would have been five stars plus if they had them in a 26"" or 27"" inseam to begin with--I know there are lots of other guys out there with the same issue.

It appears that the stitching along the top of the waistband came undone and then so did the pants!  Every belt loop is hanging as is the still lining.  This must be a quality control issue as the pants were being worn for a few hours at a pistol range, not for a WWE match or a wedgie contest.

I'm a mechanical engineer and as part of my job I find myself inspecting components out in the shop from time to time.  These pants are very good quality and are very stain resistant.  I agree with other people who said that these pants run slightly smaller then other brands of pants.  For instance, I normally wear a 34x30 but for these I consistently need to get a 36x30.  That being said, the fit of the 36x30 is consistent every time I order a pair, so once you find your size you can order that size and feel confident it'll fit.  For the price you can't beat these work pants.

Thank you to all the other reviewers for warning me about size. I typically take a 38/34 pant to get a loose, comfortable fit. Heading the warnings I bought these Dickie's work pants in a size 40 waist and they fit perfectly, even slightly snug. I can't imagine trying to get on a size smaller and expecting them to be comfortable on an 8-10 hour workday.The length seems exactly correct but buyers should definitely order a size or two larger in the waist.Other than that, I've yet to break them in so the material is a little stiff but not uncomfortable and the metal clasp is definitely better befitting my work uniform than a button. I think I'll own these for a long time.

I labled this as ""somewhat large"" only because I didn't know my husbands length/inseam but I knew his waist size so I ordered the longest inseam available and they ended up being almost 5 inches too long. But it's better than too short because all we did is go to the tailor and have her take them in and they fit him perfectly. I'm only giving it a 4 because he haaaates the slip/clip closure on the pants instead of a normal button. But the pants themselves are great, fit great, look great, I'm hoping they will hold their color since they will be washed at least 3 times a week due to his work.

I wanted to try Dickies for a more durable work pant over jeans.  I'm frustrated that the belt loops are only for 1-1/4"" belts.  The first time I wore them with my current 1-1/2"" belt, I was able to get the tag end through the loop but had to take a hammer to the metal aglet on the end because I couldn't get it back through the loop.  This was all while wearing the pants because I couldn't loosen the belt to take them off!  Very awkward to do.  Mine also had a very chemical smell before washing but it did go away after the first wash.  They do seem to be more durable than denim, earning them the second star.

These pants are a rugged, somewhat rough duck fabric.  They are not a smooth twill texture (like Dockers). My husband can wear them to his workplace and look crisp and presentable, however.

It has not faded through repeated washings. I think these are an excellent value.  They seem to be cut to fit closely to the body, so if you are chubby, you might want to buy bigger rather than smaller.

If you have big legs don't bother with your these. Based on the fit I'd have to go 1-2 sizes up to get them to fit. And the material isn't very comfortable, couldn't imagine working 8 hrs in them. I know a lot of people love this brand it's not for me though

Perfect for my brother's job. Very sturdy fabric and construction as is typical with Dickies work pants. Having had these pants in the years past I can say they never fade nor wrinkle nor fall apart! They're definitely not for the club but they certainly are perfect for blue collar work pants.

Excellent Pants for Working in Fast Food
","
These pants are great. I work at Whataburger and it gets quite hot when I work the grill, these keep me cool compared to the nasty black denim I  had to wear because I couldn't find my size in-store. But the price was cheaper online even with shipping. I bought two pairs of them for 36 bucks with free shipping that was super quick. If I would have bought them in-store i would have spent $50 on two pairs plus the 10% tax in my state. One thing that i did notice is that they need to be broken in and washed before you use them because they are super stiff when you get them. Overall i see them lasting a very long time and they are super comfortable. Definitely recommend.P.S. - if you work in fast food like i do, they don't hold that nasty grease smell after washing which is a plus in my opinion.

These are cut or labeled incorrectly. Ordered a 30x30 which is my normal pant size and could not pull up past my thighs like it was a youth cut?

Reviewers said order a full waist size up, so I did. They couldn't fit or look any better! Wrinkle-resistant and functional, with perfect inseam length. These are heavy-duty Dickies quality.The leg fit is comparable to relaxed fit in jeans, not tight or overly loose. There's no cutting in the middle, so the rise is just right on the pair I got. Sit or stand in comfort.Order up a waist size and you can rely on these pants to be exactly as advertised.

Economy Work Pants, Scratchy Material, Not Very Comfortable
","
I used to wear these for BOH cooking and FOH serving. They look way more professional than black baggy chef pants but are also not as comfortable to wear. Really poor quality linen is used in these pants; it's a very scratchy, stiff, dry material and will tear in the crotch area over time (happened to my last 2 pairs). Always buy a size up or two, they ride really high on your stomach unlike most pants. The waist is by no means stretchy so it may be way uncomfortable for larger people.

As far as fitment goes, I highly suggest trying them on at a store beforehand. I am a 34 Waist and 30 inseam in these pants. In casual jeans I am a 30-31 Waist and 32 inseam.The quality of the material and stitching is second to none for the workplace. They don't fall apart like some jeans and work pants.Being completely honest, the fitment isn't the greatest on me, but for the price and quality of material, I am willing to live with them. I actually bought 10 sets in assorted colors.Before anyone asks, they are made in Honduras.

Always try Dickies on before you buy.

I love Dickies work pants and will continue to purchase them in the future. That being said, don't buy them online. Their sizing is way too inconsistent to trust you'll get the right fit. Even when purchasing in a store, try on every pair. Don't trust the labels, or even your own knowledge of what size you wear. I just returned two pairs bought from Amazon for being way too small for the size listed on the tags, and they are not even consistent with each other. I knew better from my years of wearing Dickies but tried it anyway. As easy as the return process is with Amazon, it isn't worth the inconvenience.

As others have mentioned, when ordering these pants be wary of Dickies brand always having a waist size too small. I am a 36x36 in almost every brand of jeans/work pants I buy and so I ordered these pants in that size and the waist was impossibly small.Other than the size they seemed like the perfect work pant with very durable fabric.

I finally found the pair of Dickies for me! I have bought a couple pairs of Dickies and through trial and error these are by far the best. They are stiff when you get them but just wash them a couple of times and they are fine. Yes Dickies do shrink a bit so I do suggest you buy a size larger and mostly air dry. This style works great for my job. They are durable and don't fade after a few washings. As long as you get the right measurements you really can't go wrong with this style of pants.

Luckily I have lost some weight, because the 36's are really more like 34's. The way US sizes work (thanks to us being so fat and self-conscious) is that sizes are actually one size big. i.e. size 34 is usually about 36 inches.So by that standard, these pants are pretty true to size. If you are used to typical American sizes, go a size up on these puppies.The pants are nice, heavy material, seem to be very wrinkle resistant.The ""Original"" fit is pretty loose in the legs for me.

These work pants are the ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!  One of my teenage boys is a Domino's driver, and he loves these pants and shorts.  My autistic 19-year-old who just graduated from high school has a new job at Whataburger, and these pants are just what the doctor ordered.

The colors I chose are never available in stores and almost always in cure an extra charge if they have them.Olive green and Chocolate.I stopped buying the garbage workwear by I won't mention a name but their initial is ""C"" because it rats and tears,these are not imitations the material is great they last years not months.The price is at what stores call clearance so you can't get workwear at a better price point .

Dickies are the most well known brand of work pant.  For good reason.  They are durable and they last.  I am pleased with the quality and fit and function of the pants.  Brown is not always the easiest color to find in men's pants.  But I found these online and ordered.  I have been happy with my purchase ever since.  You can't easily destroy a pair of Dickies pants.

The smell of new pants
","
It is fine, just a regular 874. What I don't like about it would be it smell. So I have to wash it a few times to get rid of it. The another two Dickies I bought with the same order doesn't have this problem, I guess it just happen randomly.

Good work pants, but ...
","
The pants are made of a durable stiff fabric which is perfect for my work. My main complaints are that the pockets are on the small side and also that there is a cream colored liner on the inside around the top which shows on the outside top. So if you have dark pants and a dark shirt you wind up with a white line around your waist line.

I read other comments about these saying that the sizing runs small, so I ordered one size larger than I normally wear. They JUST fit with no room to spare. That said, these are an excellent value. The price is very good, and they are very durable (almost like denim). These are work pants for a plumber or mechanic that also easily pass as casual office/business attire. I wear them in an office--but I carefully cut off the little logo patch. I'll buy these again.

Dickies Men's Original 874 is a great multi-use pants.  They wear forever; they clean up like a dream; they hold their press well; and I find them comfortable to wear.  I wear them for work, wear them for everyday wear and even wear them with a sport jacket.At the time I purchased this pair labeled Stone, the Amazon.com product description photo was reversed with the color for the Khaki pants.  I ordered the Stone colored pants since the description showed the darker khaki color that I wanted.  Sure enough, the pants came in the light tan color.  So I ordered the Khaki version with the photo of the light colored pants.  They came in the dark khaki.  If you want khaki, order Khaki.  I hope Amazon.com corrects the photo switching error.

This is a repeat purchase. These are roomy enough to be comfortable work pants without looking sloppy. It is nice to be able to buy a size 33 waist, so they feel just right. They hold up extremely well and last a long time. The knees wear out first, but I apply iron-on patches and get lots more mileage out of them. They wash well and come out of the dryer looking nice. I buy them here because I can't always find the right size  at the store.

Good Product. Be aware however that sometimes the pants or shirts can be slightly a different shade (darker/lighter) in appearance than the last pair you may have ordered. Look closely at the numbers and color identification info. Sadly, I believe these may be manufactured in China or another place overseas and then later brought back to sell, so they could perhaps not be fair trade.

These pants are great! I Bought them for my husband who repairs ATMs, he had worn the knees out of 6 pairs of pants in 4 months and was always staining them with grime.

I had to get a 36"" waist in these..I went to Walmart and tried these on and then purchased them from amazon because the were cheaper..I would purchase these again..Easy care, no wrinkle.

I originally own a Khaki pair which I bought in person, love the fit and material. I figured to get a couple of more in a range of colours and I am not disappointed... Love them all. I work in the hospitality business and I have to dress accordingly, I can't do the thin slacks and all, too expensive and i'm the roll my sleeves up type of guy, I can't worry about getting my pants dirty or messed so these do the job of still making me look professional and being able to to roll my sleeves up and get the job done around the workplace.

A 38 inch waist is about 1 inch too big for me typically and so is the best fit for me. This pant size was about 4 inches way too small for me and I couldn’t even pull them all the way up to my hips.

My elderly dad loves these Dickies work pants and wears them for everything, including church.  It had been hard to find them locally in this size, so we were very pleased to find them on Amazon (at a lower price than Walmart).  They arrived in a timely way and fit him perfectly.  I think it's possible they run a tad small, since for years he always wore a 36 waist in other pants and doesn't seem to have gained any weight.  But the Dickies in 36 waist have been, according to him, too small,  while the 38 waist is perfect.

Waist fit problem
","
The pants themselves seemed to be good quality and fit great down the leg. The problem was the waist fit. These pants ride way too high—coming up to the naval, which I thought was odd for Mens clothing. The band has no stretch whatsoever so I was forced to return them. I don’t consider myself “fat”, but my stomach is wider around than my waist. Beware the fit! Measure around your stomach for the waist size and you should be good to go, assuming you like high-riding clothing.

I am glad that I read the reviews before ordering. They run small. I wear a 36'W, ordered a 38 and they fit. Length is true. The rest of the fit is loose enough for squatting, bending and kneeling, IE work pants. They look good enough for business casual when needed. They are 65% poly and 35% cotton. There is enough cotton for comfort (breath-ability), and the poly keeps them wrinkle free right out of the dryer.I am in the appliance business, and prefer these over jeans when working. However, I do not think they will be warm enough when temps drop in to the 30's or less, hence 4 stars. Maybe I will try some light long underwear so I can use them for winter rather than go back to the jeans. A good value at this price. I reordered, and now own 6 pairs.

Perfect Pants!

First off, sizing: As other reviews have stated, order the next size up from your true waist measurement. I typically wear a 34x32 pant, but I wear a 36x32 in these Dickies pants. Inseam is true to size.That being said, these are by far the best value out there for casual or work pants. Yeah, they're synthetic material, but they don't feel like it once broken in a little. I wear these instead of typical khakis since they will last an unbelievably long time, and they look far better than any pair of pants from a department store. Dickies really hit a home run with the cut of these pants. Roomy pockets and wide belt loops are nice touches. What I like best about these pants is the fit. It really is a classic, traditional fit. They sit at the waist, where pants belong, instead of down around your hips like 95% of pants and jeans these days, which makes them remarkably comfortable. There is plenty of room in the front and the seat for your anatomicals to rest comfortably without scrunching, wedging, or making you look like you're wearing balloony dad jeans. Honestly, I don't think a tailor could make any other pair of pants look as good as these. My wife says my butt looks amazing in them. The best part is that I can go from wearing these with a blazer to crawling under my car to work on it, if I really felt like it, without worrying about ruining the pants -- Wonderful!I've decided to forego the retail stores completely from now on and stick to these Dickies whenever I'm not wearing jeans. So far, I have them in Charcoal, Navy, Khaki Tan, and Silver Gray, and I plan on getting more. And why not, for 20 measly bucks?!

I like these pants, but had to order them twice, since they tend to run small.  They are comfortable, very heavy weight and hold a crease very well.  The only other thing I am disappointed in them is that the front pockets are very shallow.

I have been purchasing dickies brand clothing for years and tgese pants are my favorite. They are affordable, comfortable, and tough as nails.

Tried to make them work. I’m a server, dishwasher, and a host at a local iHop. For one they are way tighter than any normal pants and you should definitely get a size or two up in my experience. Unfortunately for me that did not have a positive outcome regardless. I still was very u comfortable and the pants were for too tight. I ordered two pair and never even opened the second. I’ve returned them and hopefully the next ones I get work better. Though they were stiff I’m sure with a few washes they’d loosen up. The pockets were pretty small but the pants felt sturdy and capable if they fit right for you.

I bought these in the same size I've bought plenty of different brands of pants in and these run by far the smallest for that measurement I've ever worn. Also, (though I suspect a few washings and breaking them in would solve this) the front of the pants seem very stiff and would most likely not be very comfortable for sitting for long periods of time. The fabric quality seemed to be top notch though, so there's that.

I have owned many 874 pants in the past. Great quality pants, but I always have to buy 2 sizes larger in the waist. The inseam size is correct, but the waist is always on the small size. For reference, I usually wear a 40 in other dress pants, and a 38-40 in Levi's 541 jeans/khakis, but I have to buy a size 44 in the 874 pants. 5 star pants minus 1 star for the weird waist sizing.

Very tight at the waist- I can barely fasten them. I usually wear a belt with a size 34 pant of any other brand, and these are ridiculously tight without a belt. 36’s are huge in comparison, way too big. Dickies needs to make a 34 that’s a 34!

High Quality Pants, Low Quality Fit
","
I bought these pants because I previously had purchased the same pant in 42x32 and they were a bit long so I hemmed them.  On this pair (42x30) the waist was much tighter than the 42x32 pair that I bought even being listed as the same waist size.As far as the material goes I couldn't recommend them more.  I work in the copier repair industry and thus get toner, grease and oils on me on a daily basis.  These pants shed liquids very well and don't take to holding toner like normal khakis work pants, etc.  They are very durable as I'm getting down on the ground a lot and they still look like brand new.  I will probably buy these pants forever unless they stop making them, but I'll be buying them in a store where I can try them on since the waistline isn't consistent in size.

Always love these pants. I buy 32-32 and they fit perfectly. They wear like iron and look terrific. In summer, they aren't nearly as hot as all cotton.

I own two of these pants, one in charcoal and the other in brown. I've been wearing both consistently since this past summer and am quite happy with them.I like these pants because they're very durable, stain-resistant, and rarely ever need ironing. If they do happen to need a press, it'll only take a couple minutes and you're good to go. Don't forget to cool iron otherwise you might end up burning your pants!My only gripe is that these pants seem to run just a tad shorter than most pants this size. For me, 32x32 is just a smidge shorter than I'd like and the 32x34 is too long. I don't know if this is just a ""me"" problem or of others have had a similar experience.Regardless, the pros far outweigh the minor con. I'm definitely sold on these pants.

I am a 34 waist and, from my previous experiences with these pants, bought a 36 (as I usually do in these pants). This was the tightest pair of 36 waist pants I have worn. There was hardly any room to ""buckle"" the little metal clip in the front. Not sure if Dickies is changing their sizing, but these seem to run even smaller than before. I suggest you buy 2 sizes larger than you normally would. I wear a 34 in most pants, but in a very few I have to go 36, these I would have to go 38. I have worn these pants for 8 years and this is the first time I've experienced such a sizing issue.

I've been wearing 874s for 25 years, and up till now the sizing has been accurate. Not any more. Hard to purchase pants on line if the sizing is inaccurate. After sending the first pair back and adjusting the size, I got pants that fit. If there was an option for ""Fit as desired"", I would have selected that.

Not real thrilled with these pants. I normally wear a 42 but I got these in 44 and they fit. I've noticed this in other Dickies pants. They were a tiny bit large but fit comfortably. They aren't very breathable. I got very sweaty in these. They do feel like they are very durable pants.

Overall good product!

Overall fit was good but the waist is made to be worn a little higher than your normal jeans so it's made a tad bit smaller than you would expect. My husband always wears a sz 28 waist and that's what we ordered. They still fit just a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Other than that the quality is exactly what you would expect from dickies and they are made to last. Great for the price.

Wash the pants before you wear them, this will decrease the stiffness.  Very little ironing is required, if any.  The pants do not necessarily need to be worn as work pants, my husband wears a nice shirt with loafers which makes the pants dressy.

these pants are easy to care for, hard to wrinkle and look nice.like i said i just don't understand why the small belt loops so I have to go and buy new belts to fit these pants.--------------------color fades quickly. Bummer.-------------------the inside of the waist band is white and can be seen when a shirt is tucked in and makes the pants look cheap and unprofessional. I use a sharpie to try to darken it but need to reapply every few washes cause it fades.

This is the second time I've ordered these pants for my husband. The fit is good, price is good and they are quite durable. I've also ordered in the past the Dickie's Eisenhower work jacket that he's very pleased with and just recently ordered the Dickies T-shirts. It's not easy to find his size in stores because he's so tall but so far his size has always been available on Amazon. Saves me from driving store to store. Some stores don't even carry the Dickie's brand. Happy to have found them here.

Dickies are very good. I prefer not to wear jeans to work and if I wear slacks or dress trousers, I get far too many comments that I'm overdressed. I keep it to myself of course that the average 8-year old looks more presentable. But I digress. With a nice shirt you can avoid looking like the intake guy down at the car repair shop, look like an adult professional, but still maintain the laid back sensibility of jeans

I've been wearing Dickies in the same size for the last 10 years or so. For some reason the clasp was over about an inch farther than every other pair of Dickies I have ever worn, making these pants  a little tight to fit into. I'm not sure if it's an amazon thing or I just got a bad pair. I recently lost about 10 lbs so they fit fine now but for the first 6 months of wearing these pants I had to alternate between having them clasped and unclasped. Just beware if you are really close to needing a bigger size these might be too small.

In my experience they run a little small in the waste, I usually wear a 40 but have to wear 42 in dickies which start snug but loosen nicely with a day or two of wear.

I would return the pants if I could, unfortunately I've never NOT fit into a size 36 before so I had taken off all the tags/stickers/etc. off the pants before trying them on.  Stupid me.That being said, my ONLY complaint is that this 36 feels more like a 34/35. 36 is usually a perfect  fit for me or sometimes a little loose but just a little.This is the first time I've put on a pair of 36w pants where I couldn't actually button the button or zip up the zipper all the way.  I even had to do the ""Jump and tug"".  You know...where you have to jump and then tug the pants up to get them on....which was a bad sign by itself.Now OTHER than that, the pants are nice.  They look great and the parts that fit on me, felt great lol.Now this could just be a fluke, maybe it's a pant that got the wrong size put on it or any other of the 100 things that can go wrong during production, but the pair I received most certainly isn't a 36w.

I bought these because they came in a 29 inch inseam and the claimed to have a waist band that sits at your true waist. The length is fine and they indeed do rest at my waist. The problem is the the rise is wrong (the length of fabric from waist to crotch). I feel like I'm advertise the fact that I am a male, there is not enough room and I'm pulling at the rear to get the seam out of my crack. My other complaint is, they came out of the bag with an unpleasant smell, stiff and scratchy. After 2 washings they still show the packing creases and have softened a bit. Fix the rise and abandon whatever your putting on the fabric before packaging and you'll have a decent pair of pants.

I bought these for my husband for a dress up event we had, I couldn't find ANYONE local that sold these in red!  Luckily Dickies pants are very consistent with sizing so I knew  exactly what size to get him online and they fit him perfectly.  I have washed these a few times and the color is still a solid red.  I don't think they will fade or get dingy any time soon!

Great pants all around, I wear them to work, casually, and formally. Dickies definitely last longer than any pair of jeans I have owned. Sure they are stiff the first couple times worn but simply wash and dry a few times and they are very very comfortable. Wearing a pair of tan dickies originals as I type this, they are the softest most comfortable pair that I own. I will never buy dickies in-store again because they never have my size 33x34 (I'm tall and scrawny) and they do not have nearly the variety. Worked in a dairy dept at a grocery store 9yrs through high school and college and I never wore anything but Dickies. Because they last.

I tried on the pants and found they were about a half size small. Feels more like a 35 (if existed) than a 36. I've never owned a pair of these Originals and so I can not really compare to anything previous. I do have a pair of shorts size 36 and they are very loose. I do like dickies, I've spilt oil, gas, other miscellaneous chemicals with no problems or bleaching. The worse chemical I've spilt on my dickies was battery acid. No holes or bleaching from it. My cotton shirts I've worn at the same time have so many holes I was shocked my shorts looked just fine. So for working dickies is my choice and the choice for a lot of other mechanics out there.

After reading reviews and to don't miss I decided to order 36... if I lock them I wouldn't be able to sit. My last travelers from Banana are 35 and they fit loose and baggy. Also got work pants on Banana 36-32 and super comfortable and great to work.

Weird/normal Dickies Sizing for popular colors?
","
I got the Grey 874 in 38x32 and it fit great. When I got the Khaki 874 in the same size, it was too large. I'm usually a 34-36"" and took the standard Dickies fit of adding 2"" to the waist. Next time, I'm ordering 36""x32"" (my actual size) in Khaki and Navy.Other than that, everything you hear about Dickies is true. Stiff at first, but becomes softer the more you wash it. Stain repellant and permanent crease. I'm never buying Dockers again!

Order 1 waist size larger than you normally wear.

Make sure you order at least 1 waist size larger than you normally wear. First pair I didn't and was just too small. Ordered another the next size up, was a good fit. This is only brand I had that issue with. Overall nice looking pants. Heavy weight, good for cold weather. Very stiff when your first get them, needs 3-4 washes before comfortable. I bought these over a year ago and liked it, so I purchased it again. No color fade after a year on the first pair, minor wear. Can almost pass as dress pants, as they keep their creases.

I am very happy with these dickies pants. So happy in fact I bought a total of 6 pairs in various colors. I had to order 5 of them from the dickies website to get my size 31x34 in all of them. I bought these to skateboard in and wear around the house or wherever when I'm not at work. My normal jeans that I wear are very expensive and loose fitting throughout the legs so they start to tear at the bottom from skateboarding. These dickies are much slimmer throughout the legs than I usually wear but I have gotten use to them. They are holding up well and look kind of cool. The are plain but still in a nice way they have sort of a dressy look to them.

Ok. So my entire closet has size 30W pants, literally EVERY single pair. So obviously I bought the 30W on here. Thought it would fit snugly like all my other pants but this one was incredibly tight, I thought this has to be 29W or 28W but no, it said 30W right there on the label. So either my entire collection of legwear is mislabeled or Dickies made it too tight for what it's measured for.

These pants are very boring.  Very, very boring.  And that's the idea.  They're not supposed to be interesting and they're not supposed to make people say ""What a stylish dude.""  They're meant to be something that covers your legs and hides your dangling bits.  They do this well, and I love these pants.

Better Than Expected

I had to purchase these to meet the dress code of my new workplace. I wasn't thrilled at first, because I'm primarily a dish washer, and typically ""formal"" type pants and water do not mix.These pants actually performed beyond expectation though. They may have an annoying hook instead of a button, but I've found the pants don't soak up water! Wearing jeans while dish washing was a drag because it wouldn't take long before they became so soaked that it felt like I was wearing wet towels on my legs. The water just runs right off these pants though, and any wetness dries very quickly.In my particular situation, these pants were a better investment than I initially thought -- I actually want to wear them to work, now!

Great pair of sturdy pants I use for work. Strong canvas material that doesn't rip easily even with a lot of bending and squatting. The sizes fit a little small. I generally wear a size 32x29 in other brands- waist being fine and 29 running a little long, but in Dickies the 32 is a bit tight (but still fits) and the 29 seems to be just about right. It may just be the style of the pants. Otherwise I love these pants, and will certainly be buying more in the future!

This was before I even washed them.  These were pants that are 2 sizes above what I normally comfortably wear.

Professional, durable and inexpensive.  Dickies pants are essential for the business casual look without the worry of tearing. I have brought the 874 work pant from the office and to the field; these pants are equally suited  for either role.  Like all true work pants, there is a level stiffness inherent in them.  But after several washings they pants will soften significantly and become as comfortable as any cotton jeans.Be aware that the 874 is not vanity sized like many other pants from different manufacturers.  These are true sizes and may fit tighter than what you would expect.

The thigh area feels too snug and the zipper will not go up, but I can button it up just fine. When you do walk it sounds like sandpaper. Haha. 4 stars because it feels sturdy like advertised but the size marketed is deceiving. If you feel you have big thighs, do yourself a favor and order a size or two higher. I should have read the reviews before ordering!

OK, try to find mens slacks in W33, I29, at a department store.It's almost impossible, because a department store will onlystock the fast moving sizes, and the heck with the rest of us.I did take a razor blade and remove Dickies label on the back.I really don't advertise for them.

Just as all the other reviews say, too small of a waist. I ordered a 36x37 and it couldn't even come close to zipping up. Apparently you have to order a waist 4 wider than you normally buy. I will give a 40x37 a try and see how those fit.

The price is right, and the length is perfect for my tall husband. I was a little miffed at the zig-zag hemline, which looks almost like a raw cut instead of a finished hem.

Dickies 874 Work Pants
","
These Dickies Work Pants were as expected.  They fit as a 38 x 30 was expected to fit.  No problems.  Our last pair of Dickies 874 was Lincoln Green and those were washed in warm water; these are washed in cold water, as they are very dark.  These pants were purchased for my daughter to wear at her job.  They fit okay even though they are men's pants, but I definitely recommend a belt.  Next time, we may look for a reinforced thigh for her pants, as there has been wear in the thigh area.

Although, the material is very tough, as to be expected of dickies... I assume once these hit the washer machine a few times they will fit/flex better. Upsize.

These are pants which I _Never_ would have taken home from the store because of the extremely harsh finish when brand-new, but after laundering 2x on the ""power wash"" setting they are are tolerable.

I lost weight, so ordered these, a size (2 inches) smaller than my last pair. Now I will say that Dickies pants run small. My waist was about 42 when I ordered the 44's. Now my waist is about 39 or 40, and these 42's fit fine. The only reason I'm not giving these pants five stars is that one of my last pair, having only been worn a few times, lost the zipper pull when unzipping them. I mean it came right off in my hand and now I can't find it of course and don't know how to fix it, or if it can even be fixed, or if it's worth what it would cost to have someone fix it. It's the first time this has happened. It did NOT happen with this particular blue pair, yet. Hopefully it will not. I love these pants in general for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they are kind of stain proof and even slightly water resistant. I did notice that these seemed too short, however, while the 44/32's I ordered in the past were too long. There is no option in between so next time I will order the 32 length as I can cuff them up, that is fine with me. UPDATE: I lost a lot more weight, and ordered a pair of 34/32's recently, which were called ""khaki"" as pictured above, and on some seller's sites that same color pictured was called ""desert sand"". The pair I received was not the light color pictured, it was a greenish tinged tan color, almost grey looking ""tan"" color. On some seller's sites they picture the color I received, calling it ""maple"" or ""washed maple"". In other photos ""maple"" is a more yellowish warm light brown. My point is, do NOT trust the photos on ANY of the sellers pages selling Dickie's work pants, at least when it comes to the tan/khaki colors. Black is black..(or is it?? haha). I kept them anyway, they are for work and it didn't matter but if you want a particular color of khaki, you better go buy it at an actual store.

Good value for the price. As expected they are fairly high-waisted, but they are the original fit. I ordered 34 in the waist and they are slightly snug, but still fit. It may be that I am not used to having the waist so high up since most of my pants sit right above the hips.

Polyester Content Makes Them A Winner
","
My husband has had three pairs of Dickies for working out in the yard.  They wash like a dream and need no ironing.  They keep their crease.  Because of the polyester content, they retain their color wash after wash and the fabric does not wear out.  The first pair we bought years ago finally needed replacement because the zipper broke, but it took years for that to occur.

Comfortable, High-quality work pants
","
I work in a restaurant, and coming in direct contact with oil is a daily chore. Because of the density and type of material, the oil rarely reaches my skin when wearing these pants. Contrary to what others wrote  the pants fit as expected, and even had a little ""stretch"" to them when checking my range of motion. Dickies have always been my go-to pants as a cook, contractor's apprentice, and because of the casual-dress look of the pants, can even be worn for (slightly) less-casual occasions. The washability of these compared to competitors is unmatched. Some of my ""off-brand"" work wear retains the smell of the restaurant indefinitely. These smell fresh after just one wash. As long as the quality remains true, I'm a customer for life.

I've been happy with these. I checked them out locally first for size and color.  I found that I needed a larger size (36w) than I usually wear (34w), so I was glad that I tried a pair on locally first.  They seem rigid as first but they do soften up as they you wear and wash them and as they break in.  I find them comfortable and they fit the bill for what I needed them for.

I've had 5 pairs of these pants for over 2 years.  I wear one pair each day of the work week.  I'm a Pest Control Technician and often find my self climbing on rooftops and sitting on them while doing exclusion work.  Before I wore Dickies, I'd wear normal dress pants which lasted a good one visit on top of a room before holes were forming.  The Dickies are tough, I've been on my knees and behind on roof tops and never had a hole.  I go under houses and have to crawl around in rocks and dirt but have yet to find a hole.  After two years of wearing these and washing repeatedly, they are finally starting to fade a little and start to get the fuzzies or ""Pilling"" on the fabric.  I also love the range of waist and length sizes.  If you're short and fat, you can get pants without hemming, if you're tall and skinny, they've got sizes for that frame also.  Its great.  If you do any sort of labor and need quality work pants, don't hesitate to order these.My only complaint is the fit, they always run a little small.  I have to buy one size up just to ensure they fit.  It's not flattering when you're picking your size but keep that in mind.Update: Its May 2017 and I still have these same pairs of pants I originally ordered. They each get worn/washed about once a week, a pair for each work day. I have a couple of pairs that are finally getting thin in the crotch from rubbing but no holes or tears anywhere.

I had to return the pants because they fit way too small around the waist. I am a 34 waist but for dickies I learned they run 2 sizes smaller. I had to buy a 36 waist. I wish they would explain this on the description.

I ordered these for work. I am a network technician and I do a lot of squatting and kneeling and these hold up better than regular khakis but still look good enough to wear in an business casual office environment.One thing to keep in mind is that they are not soft at all and they do not seem to soften over time. You are sacrificing some comfort for durability. They hold up great though.

Very durable fabric that doesn't fade after multiple heavy soil washes. Caution if you are using the slacks to work in a greasy kitchen.

Great material.  These pants seem to be be very durable but the do run very small.  I am a 34X30, and by reading the reviews, I ordered a 36X30 thinking that would be enough.  Wrong, I think I would need a 38X30 to be more like my 34X30 normal jeans size.

I wear Dickies 873 with a 34"" waist so I bought two pairs of the 874 with a 34"" waist thinking they would fit. But the 874 is WAY to tight in the waist by two inches! They are both Dickies pants so I don't understand this. A 34"" waist should be a 34"" waist regardless of what style or # the pant is. They are all Dickies! My advice is to try them on in the store first because with Dickies you never know what you are going to get.

I generally don't shop for clothes online due to needing something quickly and not certain that the garmet will fit correctly.Well with Amazon's prime two day shipping, and actually after shopping 6 different stores for a basic men's white slack and not finding one,  I found a great selection on Amazon. I chose the Dickies, and the slacks fit perfectly!Can't be any happier, not certain how retail stores are going to last after not even offering one choice of white slacks.

Great pants, awwwwwweful sizing! Some people say purchase them one size up. That’s what I did. I wear a 30 waste in every single brand. I bought 31 in these and couldn’t get them closed. No quality control whatsoever! I’m going to try 33.

These are cut to sit at your proper waist (i.e. around your belly button, the product picture is accurate), unlike most modern cuts which are around your hips. So, for me, it's a bit smaller than expect, but otherwise the quality is good and I just need to lose some weight.

Price Comfortable but Pant Isn't
","
I bought these Dickies for my son (his shop class requires them). The pants are made well and are a decent price!  However, my son says they're not comfortable. The rise is too high meaning the waist line fastens well above the belly button and the pant leg is about 2"" longer then the 36"" denoted on the pant. I can hem so it'll work for us. If you don't sew, don't buy these or be willing to pay for the alternations. There are other Dickies those styles are size accurate and comfortable. For my son's sake, I won't order the Original 874 again.

Not for me 874 I love my double knee dickies!!!
","
The dickies original 874 do not fit the same way as my dickies double knee ones do. I ordered the 874 because they do not have my waist or length even closely anymore on Amazon in the double knee so I figured I would try the 874, order the waist 2 sizes up, the shortest length Amazon had  in stock and hem them the rest myself. I have the Amazon store card and I needed a few new ones for my new job, they didn't like the bottoms frayed and not neat and clean so I ordered up these 874. My reasons I didn't like the 874 were: i don't like the clasp, it feels cheap n easy to bend, I didn't like how they sat on my waist, the pockets felt smaller then even my new double knee pants, I like the cell phone pocket I have the iPhone 6s with otterbox on it and the phone stays in my pocket as long as I don't put my butt to the ground while on my feet ( have a standing up job), and these were alittle tighter at my thighs.I have had the double knee ones 5 pairs now down to 4 in good work attire minus the bottoms being frayed since 2005 ( last pair is a mess around pair still wearable). Don't get me wrong they are stiff as hell for quite some time after wears n washings, the 874's I got from Amazon had the same feel to them new as my new double knee does. Takes at least 10 wears/washings to start a good break in. The stitch work at the seams is the same quality as its been for me for over 10 years now on both types.Like all dickies order at least one to two full sizes up the normal jeans/ work pants. Now if your dickies you have are extremely old before you buy a new pair I'd say go to anywhere that sells the exact style you want and try on a few sizes, find your waist size and then order em here. Dickies sizing has gotten alittle worse over the years and a little more unpredictable. Most places don't sell the bigger waist with short leg length in above size 36 waist in stock.  So if you at least get your waist size from a new pair of dickies and you know your length you'll be fine (length for me has always been true to its size).I washed my double knee every week, I was a mechanic and a cook for all my years of wearing them so they got dirty. Never got a hole, cut or button pop off, I would say based on having the 874 in my hand and feeling them they would be the same. being a female and woman's work pants back then were thin, light weight cheap products I loved my men's dickies, now they have women's ones out there that are okay but not the same as the men's. Lucky for me a local store did an exchange for me n I just paid the difference in price and got the pants I like better.

Husband loves these, uses them for work. He says they are so comfortable, they have been washed several times and have not faded like that Jean material. They cleaned out very nice with just a wet rag during the day. And they look like brand-new still. We will be ordering these are done.

These pants are a true fit...stiff. I suggest washing them a couple times with softener before having to wear them for any length of time with lots of motion.

Shouldn't need to worry about the work dress code for as long as the job holds...

Too Small But Not Giving Up.
","
I have tried to guess my ""Dickies"" size twice now to no avail. I have these exact pants at home but in their beige/khaki color and they are 30 x 30. They are a little snug so I thought I would go up a little to a 32 x 29 because I am also short. The pants that were delivered got here in a timely fashion and were PERFECT in length. The issue was the fact that I could not fit them around my waist. The felt like they were 28 or 29 in width. So I went up from there to 32 x 30 (fully aware that I was buying what may have been longer not wider pants) knowing that some companies do the numbers backwards. I do not know if that is the case with Dickies but the second pair came in two days and when I tried them on/ sure enough they were closer in the waist but still too snug for comfort. I would say they were maybe a big 29 or a small 30. I plan to keep trying so long as they are willing to keep sending. I will keep you all updated on my findings. So far, other then the size issue, returns and re orders have been smooth. This company seems very legit in their customer service. Once I find my size I plan to get a few more pairs in different colors.

I bought these pants for my husband. He has to wear a uniform for work and we had been trying to find a pair of slacks that would actually fit him without having to be hemmed.

Great School Pants for My Teen

My teenage son needs to wear khakis as part of his school uniform. I love how Dickies offers such a wide range of sizes. I used to hem his pants all the time because the ones that fit his waist were always too long. Not with this pair of pants. I measured my son and ordered according to the measurements and these pants fit him perfectly. I love the sturdy construction and stain resistant treatment. He loves the crease and thickness which give him the look he likes. We highly recommend these pants. While they cost a bit more than other khaki pants, especially those labeled ""school uniform"", the quality is worth the few extra dollars. Here on Amazon is where I found the best deal after thoroughly comparing prices.

As another reviewer said, these tend to run small.  I ordered a sized larger than normal and the fit is still a tad bit snug. The material has some stretch, so I'm not returning these for an even larger size.  After 1 trip through the washing machine and a day of being worn, the pants are much more comfortable than when I first put them on.  The only other critique is that the front pockets could be a little deeper.  Otherwise, I like the pants and they meet my needs very well.

These are like dress pants in more industrial disguise
","
The build quality of Dickies pants are incredible.  These things are practically indestructible.  I have them in a half dozen colors.  Some of them I've been wearing for over six years.  Here's what I love about them:1.  Fit:  The cut is like dress pants.  Especially the 874 model.  I work at a financial services firm where looking the part is important and they have a dress code policy.  I can wear these to work with a dress shirt and people think I'm wearing dress pants.  They slightly taper to the bottom and they fall perfectly over dress shoes.2.  Material:  It is a really solid poly/cotton blend.  The stitching and hardware is very good quality.  I have never had a seam come undone or a button pop off.  Zipper never gets stuck.3.  Permanent Press:  Much better than dockers and all those other ones.  The permanent press lasts on these.  I can take them straight out of a hot dryer and I have a perfectly pressed dress pant.4.  Comfort:  A little stiff when you get them brand new... need to be broken in a bit by wearing a couple of times and a wash.5.  Color fast:  The colors remain true.  No bleeding or fading.  I have dark ones which have been through the wash and they still look like the original color.  I can't say this about any other cotton/blend pants.6.  Stain resistant:  I can spill food on it and as long as I rinse it off, it's as if nothing happened.  The material is thick so liquids don't immediately soak in.7.  Price:  They are priced right at about $20.  Try finding all the attributes listed for that price in another pant.8.  Consistency:  I have been buying the same cut for years and they are exactly the same.  I don't have to worry about them changing the design to follow the trendy fads of the year.9.  Temperature control:  During winter, the thicker material helps keep me warm without having to wear leggings.  The thicker material also acts as a wind block, unlike thinner pants.10.  Travelling:  For all the attributes listed, they are the pants for travelling.  Low maintenance, high performance.

After reading that the sizing was a bit small on some reviews, I (32x30) decided to get a couple inches wider just in case. The pants read 34x30, but measured 29x32.

Dickies pants are the best ... like Kevlar for the office.
","
I love these pants.  From their cardboard-like stiffness to their seat-belt-rough texture, Dickies are the best.  I do take the bright tag off the back so that I can wear these to my office job (people don't like to see me in ""blue collar"" clothes when I'm handling their finances), but they are great.  They don't shrink or fade, and they're practically indestructible.  The best part is that they're so affordable that I can have a pair for each day of the week.  The *only* thing I wish they would change is the height of the waist.  For me, they would be more comfortable (and I think look more stylish) if the waist sat just a little lower.  At the end of the day, these are still my favorite dress pants of all time.  Get some... expect them to feel like kevlar (and wear like it too), and you'll love them.  ... a true bargain in a world of cost-cutting.

It pretty much should definitely be washed before wearing as the material feels rough and stale at first. I bought these pants for a bigger size than mine to use for a cosplay I am currently working on. I am a female so I had to go between my waist and hip sizing to hopefully have something that would fit but wouldn't be too tight. They need some work but will definitely work out for what I have planned for them :)!

I've had some pairs for over 5 years now with lots of washes and wearing daily.  Material is so much more comfortable than jeans after a couple washes.  In fact, i use to wear jeans every day.  No more.  Only my Dickies.

I often must transition from labor to jacket and tie with no time to change into a suit.These flat front pants have no visible markings to identify them as work pants, and with a little brushing offcan pass for dress pants, yet they are far more durable and longer lasting than standard dress pants or khakis.I own ten pairs of these and after years of trial and error have found that no other pants are in the same category.If the fabric was even of a slightly higher grade, these Dickies would easily earn 5 stars from me.

If you really want a pair, order two sizes larger then you regularly wear.  Whoever is in charge of measuring Dickies on the assembly line, they are overwhelming failures. I have purchased Dickies shorts in the past and found that they (more often than not) run small/tight in the waist. Keeping that in mind, I ordered my pair larger. I have a 36"" waist and order a 38"" waist pair of these pants. After getting them, I tried them on right after I took them out of their packaging. These things are sooo small/tight I can only think they have a 33"" or 34"" waist! I double checked their size tag and sure enough, it reads 38""x34"". Unbelievable. Luckily the other pants I ordered at the same time, from a different company/brand, fit perfectly. Way to fail Dickies, way to fail.

The pants were sized properly. The 38 inch waist I ordered was accurately size. Don't go with the size you're used to in your closet. Other companies undersize their pants to beef up the male ego. I forgot this basic rule and ordered what I thought was my proper fit. For these pants, measure your waist line. Another way to do it is to go to a mens store and have them properly measure your pants and go with this measurement.  The pants are of a high durability. I did order a pair of 40's and they are a better fit. i defenitely am pleased with the ruggedness of this product.

These fit a little small around the waist, primarily because they sit much higher on the waist than other brands like dockers. But otherwise, I was thrilled to find a unique size (33x31), plus they are really comfortable and wear well

great Dickies pants
","
I tried the washed just to see the difference. my preference is the traditional, ""stiff"" need to be washed pants. I am not a workman so I wear these pants for fashion not utility. the size is good, and I like the baggy thigh, looks great with Dr marten boots.The next pair I buy will not be prewashed, but if you wear these pants for work, I would reccomend them, they are like the non washed, just 5 washes ahead.I reccomend!

Awesome work pants, i love the material usually I wear a 28x30 but the 29x30 worked perfect.UPDATE: It's been nearly 3 months I've been wearing these pants about 3-4 times a week. Still no shrinkage, holes, stains or rips. They wash and dry very nice and the best part is I never have to iron them. They fit snug ever since my first time wearing them, which looks professional, Baggy clothing is bad!

So save yourself the trouble of ordering something too small or big by just going to a clothing store like Kohl's or even some Walmarts and compare the size before purchasing off Amazon.Other than that happy with my purchase.

Sickest pants out there! Especially for skateboarding, very little fade, no shrinkage, no wrinkles. They're the best! Only thing is that they come waxed so they're really rough and stiff, not so nice in hot weather but after a few washes they become perfect. They're really hard to rip through, I skateboard which means I fall a lot, they rip for me in about 2 months. Overall these pants are durable, nice looking, and really worth the 20 dollars you'll be spending.

Product is very stiff (kind of typical for Dickies). Due to high waist, you definitely need to order 4"" larger than your typical waist size if you have a gut. If you are flat bellied, then I suspect you'd order your normal size. To be safe, I'd measure at your natural waist (belly button) where the pants sit.

I read the reviews on here and was naturally expecting that the pants would be too tight, so I got the size that was 2 up from what I usually wear. But that wasn't enough! If I had known these would be that tight, I would've gone up a little more (maybe 3-4 sizes to account for dryer shrinkage). I bought two pairs and will likely be sending the other one back. This product needs to be resized by the manufacturer, but in the meantime... I highly recommend buying pants that would normally be too big for you. The skin on your waist will thank you. Mine has been terrorized.On the plus side, they are pretty thick and protect my sensitive legs from the winter weather. I imagine they wouldn't be too comfortable in the summer, though.

My size 36 pants are getting tight at the waist so I've started getting size 38.  The Dickies size 38 seemed almost, but not as tight as the other 36 pants I already own.  Other 38 pants I've bought seem a tad larger.  Also, the top part of the pants seems to fold over due to my girth, showing a white area that's quite obvious and looks as if one's underwear is showing.  All said though, it's a good price for these pants.  Haven't had the first washing yet and don't know if it fades or what happens when washed.

Poor construction does not last
","
I have been wearing dickies for the last twenty years and have relied on the sturdy build comfort they offer.  The last two batches I have purchased have ruined the image of quality I have come to associate with the dickies brand. The first problem I now have with the product is the material, its rough  ten washes in and its like sand paper crossed with plywood. The other main complaint I have is the way the pants are constructed using a single thread to hold the inner and outer pieces together along the top of the belt line. Once the single thread holding the pants together breaks the product quickly falls apart. I purchased twelve pants in two different batches and two different sizes and nine broke.I don't know if i snaged the thread on something on the job site or it just broke, to be honest it should not matter one stich failing should not destroy a product.

Why buy jeans when you can buy Dickies?

Dickies makes a quality product. The fabric is super durable, comfortable after a few washes, and the cut of the pants is classic. I purchased two pair for my husband and he claims that he will never buy jeans again - they just don't compare to Dickies when it comes to durability. The waist measurements run a little small, so I recommend ordering one waist size larger. Luckily, my husband had already discovered this before I ordered these and the next size up fits perfectly!

One word of caution though: make sure you are outside shen you take them out of the package. Let them air for a bit then straight into the washer. They have a very strong chemical/urea type smell until they are washed.

I bought these at an inch more at the waist than what my other pants are, yet they were still too tight around my waist. I was able to put them on, but they were very uncomfortable.Furthermore, my belt (a pretty standard sized belt) wouldn't fit through the belt loops. I folded and pushed and pulled and managed to get the belt through a couple loops before realizing I was going to be late to work and just gave up. (Good thing they're so tight around my waist, I guess.)I wore them the one time. I guess I'll hold on to them in case I lose some weight. And buy a thinner belt.

I didn't like the polyester fabric to begin with. It was heavier and harder than what I wanted. I was looking for something softer and lighter to wear casually and for long hours like a pair of khaki pants. This was my fault because I didn't pay close attention to the type of fabric listed. Some people might like it though because it can be sturdier and more resistant to heavy use.Note that the color listed as ""khaki"" is not a classic beige khaki. It has a bit of an olive tint which you can't tell that well from looking at the pictures. I think the ""desert sand"" might be closer to a beige but I'm not that sure since I never ordered it.I ended up returning them mostly because they were the wrong size. They run smaller and shorter than the sizes I normally wear, which tend to be consistent even across multiple brands. I had to sort of squeeze myself for them to close. The length was too short as well and I could clearly tell when I'd sit. If you order them, I suggest trying a size bigger and longer. Even better, physically try them first at a nearby store if possible. This is one of the reasons I don't like ordering clothes or shoes online. Can't try them on or look at them close enough. Fortunately, Amazon makes returns easy. Still, it's a bit of a hassle having to order and send back multiple sizes.

I've got a few Dickies jackets and they're great. Decided to get a few denims and trousers from the same brand, I don't like them. The buckle-to-crotch length is way too much.

I don't get it. On the plus side, quality seems good

These fit terribly in my opinion. The pockets on these pants are horrible, especially for work pants. If they were dress pants, and I wasn't expected to put anything in my pockets then no problem. But, I imagine with work pants, most people will be keeping stuff in their pockets. These pockets were easily 1 to 2 inches shallower than comparable denim jeans pockets I owned. I was very disappointed. The fit was snug, but apparently these are a truer fit than regular denim, but I didn't find them comfortable in my size, which was hard get as I am taller.

The fit is definitely small and unpredictable with these. Even if you buy one set of 874 work pants in one color and size, the next time you order the size may be completely off. Thankfully there are free returns so you can get what you need.I normally wear a 34x40 jeans. For these 874 work pants I own three pairs, two of which are 36x30 and the other pair is 38x30. Make sure you order a waist size 2-4 inches larger than you normally wear.

Dickies are as durable as they come, they are quite stiff and scratchy when you put them on the first time, but don't worry. After a couple washes they get more comfortable. They DO NOT FADE, which is awesome and are virtually indestructible. Be advised, the way they fit a little higher on the waist, you may need to get a larger size waist size then you're used to, at least this was the case with me. Hope this helps, happy shopping!

That said, when I say it fit ""as expected"", that means it's at least 2 inches smaller in the waist than the size given. That is how Dickies work pants are sized (so are Carharts). So 44 fits like a 42, 42 fits like a 40, etc. They do NOT shrink, however. It's just how Dickies sizes these type of pants for some reason. I only wore these a handful of times because I ended up losing a lot of weight.

Some people have complained the pants are a little small but they were fine for me.  They are good and durable work pants.  If perfectly new you might be able to pass them off as regular everyday pants but that isn't exactly what their meant for.  They hold up well to grease and oil as a mechanic, just wash your work clothes separately (duh) and you will be fine.

I can go from one job to the next and know that I'll be dressed well enough to fit in.  I'm constantly getting my pants muddy but it doesn't matter.  I didn't spend much on them.

I love Dickies, but hate their sizing inconsistencies. A 34 waist in these is to small, even though I wear a 32-33. If I go up a size to 36 then the clasp won't stay closed because my belt will have to scrunch several inches of material forcing the pants to droop down in the crotch area. I have some Dickies uniform relaxed shorts that I can never seem to find anywhere  that fit perfect at 34. Come on Dickies, get it together!

874 is the standard by which all my other pants are judged. I don't need no dang utility pocket for my stupid phone, just give me the basics. I'm sick of so called ""performance wear"" and the like, whatever. Dear Dickies, don't ever change the 874, they are perfect.

First of all. I am in a wheelchair. That being said, I love these pants for a number of reasons. Most of all because they ARE 65% polyester, they are much better for sliding on a slide board to and from my wheelchair. Now the waist size is at least one size too small. I held them up to the 38"" I have now, and the 40's are the same. Also, I wanted at least one size bigger, as it's hard accessing pockets when you are sitting! One thing more, I loved the 17"" inseam shorts Dickie used to sell, so I buy the shortest inseam possible, usually 28, and turn them into long shorts!
